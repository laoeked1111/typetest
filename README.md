# typetest

This is a type test made in Python. Gives the raw and actual WPM, accuracy, and consistency.

## Usage

Running `main.py` will start the program. Select one of the test types:
1. A "finite" test is one in which a finite number of words must be typed with no maximum time limit.
2. A "continuous" test is one  in which as many words as possible should be typed in the given time limit.

This program makes use of the curses library, which is available automatically for MacOS and Linux installations of Python. For Windows, run `pip install -r requirements.txt` to install `windows-curses`.

## Credit

The list of words I used is from [this repo](https://github.com/MichaelWehar/Public-Domain-Word-Lists).
