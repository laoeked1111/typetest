# typetest

This is a type test made in Python. Gives the raw and actual WPM, accuracy, and consistency.

## Usage

Running `main.py` will start the program. Select one of the test types:
1. A "finite" test is one in which a finite number of words must be typed with no maximum time limit.
2. A "continuous" test is one  in which as many words as possible should be typed in the given time limit.

## Credit

The list of words I used is from [this repo](https://github.com/MichaelWehar/Public-Domain-Word-Lists).
